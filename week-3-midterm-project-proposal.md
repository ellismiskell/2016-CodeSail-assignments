###### Example:

Problem:
- My sister is always forgetting what homework she has to do & what to bring to certain classes each day

Sub-Problems/User Stories:
- As a user, I don't want to have to make a calendar alert for each individual homework assignment, but I need something more specific than "math homework"
- As a user, I want to get reminders before I leave in the morning for what I have to bring to class so I don't forget things
- As a user, I want to be able to easily keep track of my schedule, and be reminded every time I have a certain class what I need to bring (e.g. calculator to math)

Features:
- creates repeating calendar alerts specific to that day's assignment
- can input yearly/semesterly schedule once, then reminds you each day at preset time
- can sync with online hw calendars
- automatically sets reminders at the same time every day; only have to manually do it once, but will change content of alert based on inputted hw
- reminders in the morning; knows if it says "bring x" to remind you the next morning
- tests can trigger a different pre-set series of reminders
